# My Neigborhood
## Cool places around my neighborhood
The intention of the app is not to be pretty but rather functional, it is part f my udacity fullstack nano degree program

### Async
    Before the application is initialize the foursquare api is caalled, if by any reason the api or the url returns an error the DOM will be clean and let the user know there is an error

#### Methods
    Main methods handle the display of the markers and the filtering of them, they self explain themselves on the code


### APIs
 Google Maps and foursquare    

### Starting the App
    This app is not using any external libraries other than boostrap, knockout and google maps and they are connected with a cdn

    Just run the `index.html` and you are good to go
